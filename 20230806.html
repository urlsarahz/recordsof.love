    <p>I want to start a blog, because I've always enjoyed journaling -- for the two-ish years I journaled every evening, anyway. Also, I believe writing is a process that allows you to better understand yourself. More on that later. After a half-year break (keeping a private journal is very difficult in a nosy household of five, and it's even harder to scribble about my day in my bed when the only light source is the light pollution from outside my window), I decided to start an experiment with a semi-public journal, which is this site. Nevertheless, it has suddenly become exceedingly onerous to write about myself. I can't seem to get a thought straight while worrying that my writing sucks, that I'm writing something objectively wrong, that I'm going to thoroughly embarrass myself. I console myself with the thought that no one is going to be interested in what I have to say here. You don't need to listen; I never said I would be good at writing, I just need to get these thoughts out.</p>
    <p>Part of the second-generation, child of immigrants experience includes squashing yourself deep within your body. I compartmentalize myself into different social identities, contorting myself into a set of traits, behaviors, personalities that people expect of me. But as Sarah fakes her way into others' good graces (as they say, networking leads to success), I'm dwindling. Forgive the cliche, but this ostensibly perfect life belies a writhing chasm of self-disgust and self-doubt. I don't really know who I am, but I hate that I can't truly be like the personas I adopt. I hate that I have to pretend to be like others and can't take pride in myself.</p>
    <p>I want to start a blog, because I can scrutinize myself for who I am. I can allow my mind to stretch past its confines. Rather than staying insular and looking inward, but finding only hazy feelings I couldn't grasp, blogging allows myself to spill all over the page (or the screen, if you will) where I can pick up the pieces of me.</p>
    <p>I purchased this domain on August 5, 2023. I don't know if I will decide to renew it after the year is up. If I do or if I don't, I hope I can become interested in myself and I can come to treat myself as important. Not in the narcissistic way, of course, though blogging fundamentally feels so overly self-inflating. Like, who the fuck would devote an entire website to themselves unless they were swaggering egomaniacs? I think everyone should start a blog. Maybe then, everyone could start treating themselves as someone worth living for. </p>
    <p>Maybe, months from now, I could publish an article where I recount about treating myself with love.</p>
